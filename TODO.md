# High priority
* Run the CSL and PSL REDUCE test suites and benchmarks
* The default browser for GUI REDUCE should be `/usr/bin/open`, not `firefox`
* The installed documentation path could be preset for "Redfront"
* Build the `breduce.pdf` document from LaTeX sources
* Build the "Inside Reduce" document from LaTeX sources

# Medium priority
* Include `rbench` and the regular test suite and benchmarks in the package?
* Install `rlsmt` with the package?

# Low priority
* Build `libreduce` (as a separate dependant package?)
* Build `qreduce` (as a separate dependant package?)
* Build `VSL` and it's documentation (just for fun? as a separate package?)
* Support Homebrew on Linux
